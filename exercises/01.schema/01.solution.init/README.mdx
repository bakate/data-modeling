üë®‚Äçüíº Great job making the schema. We're a little ways away from actually being
able to use this in our application since we've got more models we need to
create, but this is a good start.

ü¶â If you would like to check out the SQL that's generated by the prisma schema
and you don't want to wait until we get to the `npx prisma migrate` exercise,
you can ask SQLite to output a SQL file that represents the contents of the
database (including tables).

First, you
will need to
[download and install the `sqlite3` CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

	I personally use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for doing this on macOS. If
	you're on Windows or Linux, please make a suggestion here for how to do this!

	For Linux users:

```sh nonumber
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
sqlite3 -version
```

Once you have that installed, then you can run `sqlite3` from the command line:

```sh nonumber
sqlite3 prisma/data.db .dump > data.sql
```

Then you can check `data.sql` and it should show you something like this:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "User" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "username" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT,
    "createdAt" DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" DATETIME NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO User VALUES('clklmcxa50000x7drb1zc5bbu','kody@kcd.dev','kody','Kody',1690490436990,1690490427769);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_email_key" ON "User"("email");
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "User_username_key" ON "User"("username");
COMMIT;
```

Cool, huh? You can do that at any time if you're interested to check out how you
could represent the current state of the database as SQL commands.
